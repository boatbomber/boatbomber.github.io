<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/open-source-hashlib/416732/1"><strong>HashLib</strong></a></p>
<p>Ported and optimized a large library of cryptographic hashing algorithms for RbxLua. It is used by the official Google GameAnalytics Roblox SDK! Very useful for security, and I wrote another module in that thread that uses HashLib to create a secure and customizable login system.</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/open-source-3d-sound-system/287330/1"><strong>3D Sound System</strong></a></p>
<p>Using an EqualizerSoundEffect and some math, I wrote a module that gives proper 3D sound with frequency dampening at realistic angles.</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/open-sourced-dual-render-scope-system/226389/1"><strong>&quot;Dual Render&quot; Scope System</strong></a></p>
<p>This is featured on the official <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2019/03/viewportframes-new-way-think-ui/">Roblox Blog</a>, as well as the verified <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1105547223515856896">Twitter</a>!
It was pretty revolutionary when I first made it, as the tech behind it had only been released very recently.</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/screen-distortion-rain/238754/1"><strong>Screen Distortion Rain</strong></a></p>
<p>This was also pretty impressive when I first made it, as the tech behind it had only been released very recently. I remastered it much later, and that&#39;s what you&#39;ll find in the thread.</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/open-sourced-viewportframe-camera-system/225714/1"><strong>Camera System</strong></a></p>
<p>Another cool ViewportFrame project. This one helped a lot of people easily implement security cameras, stadium jumbotrons, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/open-source-smoothscroll-module/313619/1"><strong>Smooth Scroll</strong></a></p>
<p>An invaluable module that overrides the janky default behavior of Roblox ScrollingFrames to achieve smooth scrolling.</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/open-source-image-clipping-module/293014/1"><strong>Image Clipping Module</strong></a></p>
<p>A clever trick using ViewportFrames to crop images with arbitrary masks during runtime, and have it in a GuiObject.
This is <a href="https://twitter.com/robloxdevrel/status/1142158443173896194">featured by the Developer Relations</a> verified Twitter account!</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/collaborative-notes-plugin-not-a-chat/357518/1"><strong>Collaborative Notes Plugin</strong></a></p>
<p>The Roblox TeamCreate chat window is filtered so poorly that it is utterly useless, so I found an interesting grey area in policy to write a plugin that uses cool networking tricks to have something that totally &quot;isn&#39;t&quot; a replacement chat. ;)</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/textbox-plus-open-source/397530/1"><strong>TextBox Plus</strong></a></p>
<p>A module to give TextBoxes more functionality, such as undo and redo support.</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/m/383771/1"><strong>Misc Scripts &amp; Modules</strong></a></p>
<p>Not all of my projects are large enough to have an entire thread of their own, so I compiled a few into this one thread.</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/open-source-viewportframe-handler/322443/1"><strong>ViewportFrame Handler</strong></a></p>
<p>A powerful module to handle ViewportFrame environments. Features include setting the FPS of individual objects, rendering humanoids and players, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/bounds-constrained-highlighter/259577/1"><strong>Bounds Constrained Highlighter</strong></a></p>
<p>A module to highlight specified part when withing set bounds. Useful for digital threat optics or detection equipment.</p>
